## Entity Framework Core - Learning 
- Approach: project based training
  YT channel  
  Pluralsight  
  LinkedIn Learning
- Code first
- Db First: reverse engineering existing Db
- Db MS Sql based Db hosted in Azure.(Arm base hardware does not handle local instance)... more to come
- Cleanup the two projects, decide which one to merge first and refactor the second one
- Document the minimum steps to start using EF Core + name of the libraries necessary to use EF Core
- Describe project infrastructure including solution and non-solutuon folder/file structures
- Attempt to explain using examples code to first joins using navigational properties
- Something to experiment with. Use code first approach and come up with a workflow, each step would return a task and work with WhenAll() extension
- Another idea, use Zoran Horvat articles and YT to learn more about functional approach in EF Code First 
- Spend no more than 3 library sessions on DSA, YT girl (see history) that teaches it
- FYI use null coalescing operator with ??= make sure sure there are s a explanations for chaining
